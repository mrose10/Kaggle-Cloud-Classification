# Understanding Clouds from Satellite Images
[Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/understanding_cloud_organization/notebooks)

*"This dataset is a result of a collaboration of 70 scientists wondering why clouds look the way they look.They found 4 types of clouds that don't fit into conventional cloud structures: Sugar, Flower, Fish and Gravel. To better understand these cloud types and why drives them, they crowd-sourced labels to build a machine learning identifier. With better identification, scientists scan better understand what drives the cloud formation and the effect on the climate."*
